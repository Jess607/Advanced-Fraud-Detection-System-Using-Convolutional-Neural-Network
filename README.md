# About The Project 
Fraud detection systems are sophisticated systems designed to identify and prevent fraudulent activities within various domains such as finance, telecommunications, e-commerce etc. Fraud detection endeavors to detect and identify fraudulent activities as they infiltrate the systems, subsequently alerting a system administrator to take appropriate action. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become one of the most exemplary neural network architectures in the field of deep learning. Given its impressive achievements in various fields, including computer vision and natural language processing, CNNs have garnered significant attention from both industry and academia in recent years. CNNs are great basis for fraud detection systems because of their ability to handle large size multi- dimensional data, possession of inherent mechanism to handling overfitting and better feature extraction properties allowing for enhanced predictive ability through the convolution of input parameters. Afrer model building and evaluation, the CNN model achieved an accuracy of 98%, precision of 96% and an f1 score of 98%
